### Hi there, I'm Mar :sparkles:

I am a dedicated Data Science student at Universidad de Buenos Aires, check my course notes at [marinomar.notion.site](https://marinomar.notion.site/) :books:

Driven by a passion for challenges and continuous learning, I am eager to expand my skills and knowledge. Over the past two years, I have developed proficiency in Python, SQL, and various data science technologies, consistently delivering results-oriented solutions.

Beyond my technical skills, I possess a genuine interest in the intersection of Social Sciences and technology, particularly in understanding how innovation impacts society. I am enthusiastic about contributing to projects with a social impact and utilizing my skills to make a meaningful difference.
